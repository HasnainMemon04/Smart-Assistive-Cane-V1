# 3D Models

This directory contains 3D models and CAD files for the Smart Assistive Cane hardware components.

## Purpose

3D models include:
- Cane handle and grip designs
- Sensor housing and enclosures
- PCB mounting brackets
- Battery compartment
- Cable management components
- Protective covers and cases

## Supported Formats

- STL (for 3D printing)
- OBJ (universal 3D format)
- STEP/STP (CAD interchange format)
- Fusion 360 files (.f3d)
- SolidWorks files (.sldprt, .sldasm)
- FreeCAD files (.fcstd)

## Usage

These models can be used for:
- 3D printing custom components
- Manufacturing and prototyping
- Assembly visualization
- Design modifications and improvements

## Printing Guidelines

- Use PLA or PETG for most components
- 0.2mm layer height recommended
- 20% infill for structural parts
- Support material may be required for complex geometries
