## 3. Core Process

### Primary User Flow

The primary user interacts with the Smart Assistive Cane through physical manipulation and audio feedback. Upon powering on, the device performs sensor initialization and establishes BLE connectivity with the paired mobile device. During normal operation, the user receives continuous audio guidance for obstacle detection, environmental conditions, and navigation assistance. The system automatically detects falls and emergency situations, triggering alert protocols. Users can access advanced features through voice commands or the mobile application interface.

### Caregiver Flow

Caregivers access the system through the mobile application's dedicated dashboard. After receiving invitation and pairing authorization from the primary user, caregivers can monitor real-time location, receive emergency notifications, and access historical activity data. The system provides configurable alert thresholds and notification preferences, enabling caregivers to maintain appropriate oversight while respecting user independence.

### Technical Support Flow

Technical support personnel access diagnostic features through the serial command interface and specialized mobile app functions. This includes sensor calibration, firmware updates, system diagnostics, and performance monitoring. Support workflows include remote troubleshooting capabilities and comprehensive logging systems for issue resolution.
